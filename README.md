# LeetCode-Solutions-with-Comments

Hi, everyone.
I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science in USC. My course starts from this fall(2016)
and ends on 2018 spring (2 years). Here is my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tongzhang1994).

Currently, I'm preparing for the upcoming Recuitment. Despite a beginner right now, I will keep on the practicing process on [LeetCode OJ](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/).
I will write down my own comments for some tricky problems from a beginner's perspective. And hope it's helpful to some people.

And if you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me!
Let's go!
