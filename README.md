# LeetCode-Solutions-with-Comments

Hi, everyone.
I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science in USC. My course starts from this fall(2016)
and ends on 2018 spring (2 years). 
Currently, I'm preparing for the upcoming Recuitment. Despite a beginner right now, I will keep on the practicing process on LeetCode.
I will write down my own comments for some tricky problems from a beginner's perspective. And hope it's helpful to some people.

Fight on!
